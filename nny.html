            <p>A modern rendition of a classic residence with a futuristic touch, purposely designed for a stop-motion animator.</p>
            <p>New New York was purely designed as a residence for a stop-motion animator. The house considered: size, area, and facilities are aimed at the upper or middle classes due to the supplies needed to make such a large house.</p>
            <p>When designing a house, the stakeholders opinion must be considered such as emotional and sensory appeals as well as current fashion trends. Therefore New – New York incorporates many modern (simplistic) aspects into its style along with a futuristic appeal through its parametric façade. The building takes direct inspiration from the film The Fifth Element and its futuristic New York setting, as the movie depicts a some-what dystopic New York where the city’s architecture hasn’t moved on from the early twentieth century.</p>
            <p>A large influence on the design of the house was the overall shape and whether it has a distinguished look and could be differentiated from others. As a result, the house retained the dimensions of a standard New Yorker house whilst integrating the required space for the stop-motion animator. The parametric façade’s purpose was to show a futuristic version of the standard New Yorker house and a tie into Leeloo’s hair.</p>
            <p>Internal spacing is another big part of architectural solutions, as by having small areas reduces open spaces and large areas can feel empty. Keeping true to the New Yorker style, a lot of space had to be crammed into a small area. By having a compromise and allowing medium-sized areas in a tall structure, it allows the client to have that open space feeling, especially in the stop-motion studio and master bedroom.</p>
